# UNP_PROJECT_PYTHON_ENGINEERING_GRADUATE_SALARY_DATASET
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for estimating student 
salaries, providing valuable insights for career planning and informed 
decision-making.
By analyzing a dataset with 2,998 entries and 34 variables, we 
explore the relationships between academic performance, personality traits, and 
employability outcomes.
By implementing various machine learning algorithms, we 
successfully created a model with significant predictive power, helping guide 
educational institutions and students in their career.
